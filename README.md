# Intesis AirConWithMe

Homey app to control your air-conditioner via the Intesis Airconwithme wifi module web server.

Continued work on the Intesis code from [Ram√≥n Baas](url=https://github.com/nlrb/com.intesis.acwm)

Thanks to Peter Eier; used his [Daikin AI](url=https://github.com/PeterEIER/nl.climate.daikin) code as a starting point for the Homey app.

Current code is only written and tested for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries air-conditioner module MH-AC-WIFI-1, but set up such that it can be easily extended for other modules/air-conditioners.

The web server API (acwm-api) is set up in a generic way, such that it can also be used in another context.
